- [ ] Column spans (omitted `|` boundaries)
- [ ] Row spans (omitted `-` boundaries)
- [ ] Horizontal alignment (left `:---`, center `:--:`, right `---:`, justify `>--<`)
- [ ] Vertical alignment (top `^`, middle `x`, bottom `v`)
- [ ] Table sections (header `===`, body `---`, footer `===`)
- [ ] Multi-line cell content
- [ ] Rich content in cells:
  - [ ] Bold/italic formatting
  - [ ] Inline code
  - [ ] Code blocks

### AST Node Structure
```typescript
interface GridTable {
  type: 'gridTable'
  children: [GridTableHeader?, GridTableBody, GridTableFooter?]
}

interface GridTableCell {
  type: 'gridTableCell'
  colSpan: number
  rowSpan: number
  align: 'left' | 'right' | 'center' | 'justify' | null
  valign: 'top' | 'middle' | 'bottom' | null
  children: Content[]
}
```

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Research & Planning
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅
**Assignee**: Sub-agent
**Completion Date**: 2025-09-11
