# ProseMirror Enhancements

- `plugin.ts` defines runtime decorations & config slice for grid-table interactions.
- Depends on schema names but does not import schema directly (see TODO comments).
- Exported via package root and included in `gridTables` plugin array.
- Update this doc alongside changes, especially when enabling hover/resize features.
